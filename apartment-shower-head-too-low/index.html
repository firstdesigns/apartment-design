Ignore the old showerhead if you have plans to change it. My boyfriend is 65 and the shower head is not tall enough for him it pretty much hits him in the chest. Low water pressure in shower could be related to simple issue or could actually be a bigger problems. Hand tighten it turn the shower on and check for leaks. Can I Replace The Shower Head In My Apartment Answered Little Upgrades.</p>
