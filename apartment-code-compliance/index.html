Generally if youre looking at an apartment complex that was built in the 90s and up to the early 2000s I wouldnt rely on the Code of Compliance. All buildings must have approved contrasting address numbers placed in a position to be plainly legible and visible from the street.</p>
<h3 id="code-compliance-works-with-owners-to-ensure-vacant-structures-are-maintained-in-a-safe-condition">Code Compliance works with owners to ensure vacant structures are maintained in a safe condition.</h3><p>Owners of buildings and occupancies subject to FC5053 shall have such buildings and occupancies inspected within the time for compliance set forth in R505-01 b 2 to confirm that such building or occupancys markings and signs conform to the requirements of this. You should also make sure to write down the date time and topic of any phone calls between yourself and the landlord or other residents that are also experiencing problems. The Uniform Fire Code requires that vacant buildings be secured against unauthorized entry. When an apartment complex is finished a final inspection is done this is done by the governing body as we know it to be the council.
