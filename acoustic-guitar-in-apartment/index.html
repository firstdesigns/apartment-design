I can tell you that when I play acoustic guitar in my apartment especially late at night I put the pick away and just strum lightly with my thumbfingers to make the least amount of noise possible. So playing through an amp in my apartment bad. Author AceMoney a 371. Last edit on Aug 26 2016. Gear Heres My Apartment Rig Rigs Guitar Rig Guitar.</p>

<p>An acoustic is supposed to be loud its meant to fill a room without an amp. An acoustic is supposed to be loud its meant to fill a room without an amp. Doing this results in a pretty quiet overall volume and Im pretty sure no one outside of my apartment can hear me playing. On the flip side if you live in an apartment and can only turn your amp on at certain times or you can only afford a terrible amp or you have sensitive ears its quite possible that practicing without an amp will be the thing that keeps guitar in your life permanently.

<p>An acoustic guitar can project a loud sound. Volume is not your friend but your electric guitar is. Your favorite acoustic can anger the neighbors just as much as a distorted electric when strummed hard. I practice with an amp everyday without headphones. The above and below neighbors may not benefit though. Tracking Acoustic Guitar Today New Songs In The Works Smallvoicerecords Recording Studio Home Guitar Studio Recording Studio.</p>
