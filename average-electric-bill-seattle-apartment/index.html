<p>About 5-10 a month I think I dont really pay attention. I have built a cash flow spreadsheet to get a better sense of how much we need to make to live in Seattle with our other responsibilities. The average two-bedroom apartment measures 1072 square feet so the average electric bill for an apartment of this size would be 8576. Your bill of course may be more or less dependent on the size of your apartment the number of appliances and their age and if you have a roommate. On average you can expect around 120 by way of electricity bills. The Cheapest States For Electricity In America Apartmentguide Com.</p>

<p>Our apartment bills Water and Sewer monthly. As a general purpose standard I lived in a moderate sized apartment in Florida and kept my computer on all the time which means higher than usual rates from constant AC and such and my bill usually ran 70 in. Hawaii ranked as the most expensive state for average electric bills by a whopping average of 18759month even though Hawaiians consume the least the amount of electricity. We analyzed the data to find the average monthly electric bill for residential households 11765month and broke the data down by state. SPU has several financial assistance resources available including flexible payment. Andante Seattle Apartments Seattle Wa Apartments Com.</p>
